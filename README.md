    <p>MY FIRST PROJECT HTML
</h1>

## ‚ùó About the project 

This project aims to refine my HTML skills, and for this, with the help of DIO.me, I was able to create a website with navigability, responsiveness, informative and much more. I hope you like the result, after all, I'm embarking on the world of Front-end, since then I've always specialized in Back-end Java and its frameworks, databases, among others. I'm excited about the result, I know it's not advanced yet, however, it's a first step towards a gigantic career that I will follow;<br>
